-- fish sauce, anything not dry tbh
+++ peanuts, adds crunch, flavor and also bulk

potentially add a bunch of cornstarch to the wet layer

100 gram cashews
30 gram ginger paste
10 gram pepper
60 gram salt
30 gram msg
10 gram fish sauce
1.3kg onion large weeknight dice
50 gram garlic powder
850 gram peanut oil
120 gram garlic

Notes:
Way way less oil, next time I would go w/ 400 grams or less.

Weeknight dice was a huge success, although with these onions, you essentially need to ensure that they are absolutely bone dry. OR else the water will leak out and contaminate everything else. I think the best approach might be to try to boil them with an oil tempature of 250-280 for like 3-4 hours, and then add in everything else.

Also the main thing to replicate the texture of the

++ peanuts, maybe 300 grams would be reasonable.
-- Oil, 500 grams is a good idea
