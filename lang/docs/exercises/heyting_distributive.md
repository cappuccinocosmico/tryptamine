Given that a heyting algebra has finite meets and joins, and an exponential of the form:

$x^y$ obeys

$x^y$ obeys

$y^x and x leq y$
and

$$

$forall z : z and x leq y implies z leq y^x $

small version of : every bicartesian closed category is distributive


want to prove

$ a and (b or c) tilde.equiv (a and b) or (a and c)$

$a or (b and c) tilde.equiv (a or b) and (a and c)$
$$
