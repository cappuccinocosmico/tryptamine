Most of the negative health consequences of alcohol (around 117 thousand per year) are completely preventable. There are other drugs out there (putting aside illegality for the moment), that target the same receptors as alcohol, and as such feel identical, but:

- Don't cause any hangovers.
- Don't cause any liver damage and other long term effects that come from alcohol metabolites like acetaldehyde.
- Don't really make you feel nauseous or sick while drunk.
- Contain no calories.

And yet these replacement drugs end up being much more dangerous then alcohol, mainly because the fact that alcohol is a literal poison makes it hard to consume an excessive amount. From your perspective its vastly preferrable drink until you throw up and have a hangover to punish you for your bad behavior, then to live in a land without small consequences and continue consuming until you eventually black out and stop breathing.

Rust is very similar as a programming language, it contains a bunch of features that are totally magical:

- Generics and Traits make writing higher level code insanely easy. In some sense its actually more powerful then classes in Python or Java, since getting rid of shared mutable data lets you do "multiple inheritance" without any weird buggyness. Letting you put even more abstraction on your abstraction. And also since the language guarantees that generics will run at the same speed as regular code there is no reason not to use them literally everywhere.
- Algebraic data types, let you encode
