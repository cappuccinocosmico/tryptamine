My favorite quote that I heard at a database development conference was, those people who have hard problems are blessed. And I like this quote because it implies that activists are probably the most blessed people on all of Earth. It is our job to go ahead and battle against the hardest battles with the most distant of odds.

Whether that's collapsing income inequality and achieving some kind of equitable redistribution of resources in society. Whether that's successfully convincing oil and fossil fuel companies to take a $1 trillion loss because they won't be able to pollute anymore. Whether that's dismantling the 200-year-old institution of policing to create a more equitable world for all.

All of these problems are almost impossible to solve. And so far, no one has been successful. Not for lack of trying. For every single one of these issues, hundreds of thousands of activists before you have tried their best throughout their entire lives to solve this problem and come up short. Which is essentially why you are stuck working on this problem right now.

One of the things I always wonder is, how can we succeed where everyone before us has failed? Because figuring out how to do that is necessary for building this movement going forward. I have some thoughts.

The human brain naturally pens itself towards thinking in a certain pattern. If you are trying to do an extremely hard thing in life, it makes sense to follow a certain pattern. Which is, get yourself in a peer group of people that are doing it relatively competently. And then try to do everything that they are doing but just slightly better.

I tend to think this works well for doing well in school, things like climbing, or having a good career. However, all of those tasks are predicated on the fact that the average person makes it. The average person in your peer group is succeeding at the task they're doing. And if you just go ahead and copy what they're doing, you will succeed as well.

This is a huge pattern in the activist community. New activists who are at a certain space will essentially copy the existing strategies of activist movements before them, or activist movements that they were at previously, and apply them directly in a new context. This is not uncommon among activists. Again, I think it happens everywhere. But the problem with this is that it only works if your peers are succeeding at what they are doing.

In activism, 99.99 to 99.9% of actions fail. And one could argue almost none have succeeded. Even looking as far back as the civil rights movement. There's a good quote from Martin Luther King where he said all of the gains we've gotten through the civil rights movement, we've gotten at bargain rates. It didn't hurt the economy at all to desegregate. As a matter of fact, it helped. But now that we are facing the problems of poverty and inequality, that cannot be solved without costing the nation billions of dollars.

Dismantling those kind of oppressive systems have maybe only successfully been accomplished never in the US, and maybe only like seven times in human history. So how would you actually do that?

The problem with implementing this strategy of copying what your activist peers are doing is that all of them statistically will fail. And you will fail right along with them. So copying isn't going to work. What could work?

One of the frameworks that has been helpful for me when it comes to thinking about this stuff is every time I try to do something new, I automatically think about all of the things I did wrong, or that the last team did wrong the last time they tried to do an activist event. Think about ways that you could potentially be. In particular, try to think of ways that if you could do it successfully, the movement could be ten to a hundred times as successful as the last time you did something. Even if that involves risk.

And I feel like this is another pattern that I see a lot in the NGO space and beyond. There is no guaranteed way to solve capitalism, solve racism, solve climate change, or solve income inequality. There is no risk-free way of achieving those goals.

Often times NGOs will compromise on things that might actually work and instead try to do things that are guaranteed to be stable, things that will not break the group apart, things that will not risk their fundraising efforts, under the intuition that they're doing a good thing. That thought is probably better as a separate article but the point is that there's no way to de-risk the fact that activism is going to fail most of the time. An amazingly successful action in my books fails ninety-nine percent of the time. And one percent of the time it has the chance of achieving long-lasting material change for people in their day-to-day lives. At some level I think that's all you can really expect out of this. And it's really easy to compromise that last bit away.

The story of how Our Children's Trust was founded always sticks with me. Mary Wood went around the country giving book tours for her book about the public trust doctrine. After she had done her entire book tour and no one had been interested in actually implementing those ideas, she decided to give a lecture at her alma mater at Oregon State University. That was the talk that Julia was at - Julia Olson, founder of Our Children's Trust. And she decided to go ahead and give it a go.

Since then that organization has been tremendously successful, especially in their latest cases in Montana and Hawaii. And I also think one of their main cases, the Juliana case, if things had gone differently, could have potentially been the single most impactful climate change action that the United States had ever taken if things had been more lucky.

People did not think this idea was going to work. Most people across the country did not bite on it. And it took Julia literally like the last stop to actually try to implement that. Throughout all of these cases people were never certain it was going to work. The support of our case ranged from "this is never going to work, it's impossible" to "this has a very small chance of working, but it's still almost certainly going to fail."

And I think that's one of the things that is important to remember is that winning is going to involve a lot of experimentation. It's going to involve taking what came before and then applying new twists on it. And trying as best as possible to get our current organizing tools to a better spot where they can actually work and invent new organizing tools. That's going to involve having to do something new because what we have done for hundreds of years has not worked - nothing has really worked on a real level in the last hundred years.
