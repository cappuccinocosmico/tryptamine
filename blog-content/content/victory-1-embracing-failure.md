This is a series of blog posts about what I think we can do as activists to more effectively achieve our goals of making the world a better place. This is not intended to be taken seriously. You should probably take this about as seriously as the ramblings of any other 23-year-old on the internet.

I often struggle with how hard the tasks we have been given are. There's a quote that's kind of funny: if you have a problem and solving it would make the world a better place, then you are blessed. And in this sense, I think that activists are the most blessed people on planet Earth.

If you had to distill our job down to one thing, it is taking hugely complicated problems like climate change, wealth and income inequality, healthcare reform, decolonialism of the United States, and police brutality - all of which are supported by trillion-dollar economic forces like the oil and gas industries, the healthcare industry, and the military-industrial complex - and somehow get our society, which is only really interested in serving those highly powerful economic interests, to vote against those embedded forces to make the world a better place. This is, in my opinion, the hardest problem in society.

And it shouldn't be surprising that given such a hard problem, we fail extremely often. It's somewhat illuminating that the last successful protest movement in the United States was, at this point in time, over 60 years old. And it's also telling that the civil rights movement didn't even obtain the goals that its founders wanted it to.

There's a very good video from Martin Luther King where he says, all of the gains we have made in the civil rights era have come at bargain rates. It didn't cost the nation anything to desegregate lunch counters. In fact, it actually helped the economy in many areas. But now that we are worried about ending poverty and getting rid of the ghettos, that is a task that will cost the nation billions of dollars.

And this failure has continued into the modern day. The U.S. government has known about climate change since 1965, and the broader activist community has known about it since James Hansen's testimony in 1988. And since then, I don't think we have moved the needle much at all. Without being able to borrow scientific advances from the semiconductor industry in the form of solar cells and lithium-ion batteries, I'm confident the world would be on a pathway to a 7 to 10 degree Celsius increase by the end of the century.

And other sectors haven't gone much better. Despite the largest protest movement in all of U.S. history with the George Floyd uprising, you've seen almost none of that get parlayed into actual reductions in police budgets or reductions in police brutality according to most statistics.

Fights against income inequality haven't gone much better. Over the last 40 years, you have seen the complete collapse of union membership in the private sector. And despite valiant efforts of Occupy Wall Street and the two Bernie Sanders campaigns, you have seen no major movement towards systematically reducing wealth and income inequality in our country. And our failure to do this has made all of those other systemic problems so much worse.

I feel like this is a really depressing thing for most activists to think about. It does really suck to think that none of the movements you have been involved with have actually made people's lives materially better. And it also really sucks from a motivational perspective. I remember thinking a while ago that if nothing that I'm doing is working, why should I keep doing anything?

I feel like that's why most activists don't think about it. Most people consider it preferable to just not think about the macro state of how much we are losing and just try to keep it small and keep it on the local scale. This bill is bad. Let's fight against this bill. We were able to successfully get this grant money. Now let's try to do some community initiatives with that. And I think that is, at some level, a totally rational response. Whatever you need to do to keep yourself engaged in this work is absolutely fine. I don't want to second-guess that.

But when I look at this history of the activist movement, I don't feel sadness. I feel anger. How have hundreds of thousands of people - or tens of thousands of organizers - across the last sixty years failed to dismantle these systems? The facts are on our side. Most people want affordable housing, affordable healthcare, an end to climate change and the endless wars the US engages in. We have the vast support of the population. And there are way more of us than there are of them. So why haven't we been able to do it?

I'll cover some of the other reasons, but I think one of the reasons is that we have shied away from looking too deeply into what we could actually do to succeed. Even considering the question "what would actually have to happen to solve climate change or achieve socialism?" would involve looking back and reckoning deeply with the fact that nothing we have done so far has worked. And that is a painful topic.

I think the process of building a better movement into one that actually works starts there. Because only when we have really understood why the previous movements have failed, can we look at that, learn from all of their failures, and try to make a better future for everyone.

And in the interest of not being hypocritical, I will say this: My name is Nicole Venner. I have been doing activism for 16 years. And nothing I have done so far has worked. The most effective thing I was involved in from 2016 to 2019, I did not help out to nearly the extent that I could have. And the work that I have done in the 2020s hasn't gone better. Despite me really believing in the theory of change and really liking the people I've worked with, it hasn't actually done anything yet. Everything I have done so far has failed. But, I am going to spend the rest of my life trying as hard as I can to not fail.
