Hi, I'm glad you found my ramblings valuable! Although the more I think about it I think I completely agree with your critique about trying to prevent the "savior" narrative in newcomers. Its good for me to remember that in lots of spaces this attitude can be extremely damaging, from needlessly escalating with law enforcement and bringing it down into the communities they are trying to protect, to bringing a bunch of unprocessed racism/queerphobia into organizing circles. However in my background of climate organizing those problematic attitudes are less likely to cause conflict since most climate activists are financially well off white people.

I also feel that I was subconsciously trying to run interference for the horrific situation that activists encounter when getting started. People often fall into joining a traditional nonprofit, and get drafted into doing a bunch of organizational grunt work like fundraising or tabling. They also get frozen out of leadership since NGO's are often undemocratic and only consider feedback from full time paid staff. Decentralized resistance movements are better IMO, but they still don't have any great ways of training and on-boarding new recruits (a problem that is made much worse by the high turnover and temporary nature of these decentralized movements.) This leads to a collective amnesia effect where all the failures and expertise built in movements don't transfer over, and also prevents them from allying with other NGO's to provide pressure towards achieving a goal.

In retrospect it doesn't seem fair to ask new people to fix this system by going off and starting their own orgs, especially when doing so could rob them of friendships that tie them to the movement, as well as elders who could pass on their own knowledge. Fixing the on-boarding process so that new recruits can

- Start doing high impact leadership work day 1 of joining an org.

- Have as many opportunities to learn and pick up new skills as possible. Even if they never apply those skills at that specific org.

- Be provided a good enough experience so that 80% of them don't leave in 6 months.

Implementing those fixes is going to be absolutely essential if we want these movements to have a remote chance at succeeding.

However, I do get that this isn't actionable advice for people in a YouTube comments section, so for those of you wanting more applicable advice, here you go:
