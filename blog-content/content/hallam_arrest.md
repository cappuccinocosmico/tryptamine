Roger Hallam, the cofounder of Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil was just handed a 5 year prison sentance for "conspiracy to cause a public nuisance". Ultimately these and similar convictions should cause every activist to adjust their security culture and other strategies going forward.

Roger Hallam is a somewhat controversial figure in the activist community known for getting kicked out of extinction rebellion due to saying some highly questionable stuff. [^1]. These discussions that Hallam raised ultimately got so heated it lead to the death of XR on an international level. (I still have some thoughts about the fourth demand and how to best do coalition work with indigenous sovereignty organisations that I will talk about in a future post) Since then he has continued to be active in the movement, starting another org Just Stop Oil that was also able to effectively get its message out to millions of people, make salient point about how rich people overvalue the prestige of their art collections.

While Hallam's arrest is a huge blow against the right to assembly in the UK, it was somewhat surprising how the conviction could have been totally avoided through better planning and security culture. According to The Guardian:

> All five had spoken on a Zoom call trying to recruit potential volunteers for the actions, which involved activists climbing gantries at strategic points on the London orbital motorway.

This sentence raises a ton of red flags, firstly zoom is not an end to end encrypted communication platform (they claim otherwise, but since zoom is closed source there is no way to really tell), also at least in my experience recruiting volunteers for a task like this should be done entirely through referrals of trusted people. After a crew is fully assembled and vetted, you can meet in person to discuss plans and rehearse before final deployment. Most activist communities who are much less experienced then Hallam, follow all these procedures

However, these are somewhat forgivable mistakes, maybe they forgot that [e2e encryption for zoom is something that needs to be enabled in the web portal](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0065408), maybe one of the organizers got comprised by a [romantic partner working for British intelligence services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_undercover_policing_relationships_scandal). However it absolutely floored me when I found out how the British government actually acquired the zoom call:

> The convictions come after The Sun infiltrated a JSO meeting and passed on recordings to police of the hardline green campaigners’ plot to scale motorway gantries.

> All five had spoken on a Zoom call trying to recruit potential volunteers for the M25 protests in 2022.

> On the call, Extinction Rebellion co-founder Hallam said they intended to cause “the biggest disruption in British modern history”.

> Sentencing the five JSO protesters, Judge Christopher Hehir thanked The Sun, saying: “I know that none of you think much of the Sun newspaper. However she and her newspaper did entirely the right thing by passing \[the recording\] on to the police.

The amount of security culture violations, this was such an easy thing for them to prevent that its hard to come up with any best practices that wouldn't have completely avoided this problem. Following super basic protocols like

- Doing any kind of vetting on people you bring to a call.

- Not having all your organizers on the call to recruit volunteers, especially when they **IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS ORGANIZERS**

- Conducting the action on a "need to know" basis, such as saying "Hey, we might be planning an action, we were looking for 25 people, would any of you happen to be up for it so I can follow up later."

- Conducting the meeting in person to make recording harder and also screen out less serious people (A thing you probably want if you are recruiting arrestables.)

- Asking friends and organizers to recruit volunteers by themselves through direct conversations with their extended networks.

- Only recruit volunteers for a direct action with 1.1 million dollars worth of damages after several calls and direct action trainings to get a good vibe check on everyone.

- (Whats funny about this is that one of the only best practices that wouldn't have helped would be end to end encrypted communications, since [bypassing the anti recording measures on desktop is really easy](https://obsproject.com/) )

I have seen organisations follow not one, but **all** of these techniques even when doing actions like a banner drops, or other low stakes actions. So failing to implement any of these tools when doing one of the biggest nonviolent direct actions of the 21st century seems unbelievable to me. Especially considering [Hallam already had already been targeted for organizing actions as early as 2019 during his time leading XR.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/roger-hallam-heathrow-government-extinction-rebellion-isleworth-crown-court-b2450616.html)

But I think I understand it a bit better now, I think there is a pernicious mode of thinking common to activists. It comes up a lot in strategy games like go or chess, where it is referred to as "Hope Chess", defined as:

> "consistently making moves without analyzing the opponent's possible forcing replies (checks, captures, and threats) and thus, if he makes one, hoping you have a safe answer next move."

This mistake is somewhat understandable, considering that a response from LE is rarely the most important factor in an action succeeding compared to stuff like attendance or social media shares. Plus on a small local level law enfcorcement reactions seem completely random, almost completely depending on who is dispatched.

However, over longer timescales, or when your movement reaches a certain level of success this strategy stops working really fast. Encountering this extreme pushback, and failing to adapt by changing tactics and organizing principles has been the demise of a fair number of social movements [^2]

I ultimately have a ton of respect for Hallam and his organizing ability, the fact that he founded two of the most successful climate movements of the 2010's -2020's is proof enough of his abilities as an effective organizer. But if the climate movement ever wants to achieve its lofty ambitions of a 1.5 degree Celsius world, they would be wise to follow this advice from [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/article/view/passive-vs-basic-hope-chess)

> If you wish to become a good player, you have to assume your opponent's will try to make their best moves. If you are in the habit of making "silly" threats that are not only easily met but, in doing so, harm your position just on the hope your opponents will miss the threat, that's a bad habit. Likely you will have to break that habit to get to the next level.

[^1]: What the right might refer to as ""Wokeness Violations""

[^2]: Social movements always fail due to a complex kaleidoscope of factors. But I would argue that a big reason George Floyd failed was that it stopped growing once law enforcement stopped inflicting easily filmable acts of violence on protestors. Once it transitioned to other forms like mass arrests for curfew violations it stopped growing and was never able to pivot into a more successful strategy. (The total lack of organisation likely made such a transition impossible, but solving that is a topic for another time.)
