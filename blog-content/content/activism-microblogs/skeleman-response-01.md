## Pendantic Critique: I think "radicals, idealists, and realists" are more "modes of problem solving" than "types of activists"

There absolutely are organizations and activists that really only focus on one type. Lots of orgs do more then one type, and activists often switch what kind of tactics they bring to bear on an issue depending on what they think is most effective.

This isnt to say ideology is unimportant, but it has more to do with unlocking different methods of solving problems. Anarchists frequently lobby regulatory agencies or canvas for political candidates. But it isn't common to find socially progressive liberals trying to shut down construction of an oil pipeline.

All the political analysis about the types is totally accurate though. The power structures try to make doing radical activism miserable and try to paint idealistic and realistic methods as easier and more effective. Likewise, always try to push the people doing idealistic activism into realistic activism using all the tricks talked about in the book.

## A couple more tricks

- **(USA Exclusive) Play around with 501c3 non profit status.** Â This is given to nonprofits at the IRS's discretion and can be revoked at any time, which can completely shut off an organizations ability to accept donations. This typically means that certified nonprofits never touch or work with orgs who do NVDA, just because planning or associating with them can potentially cause problems for the org's certification.

- **Power needs connections.** An org/activist can totally tank their credibility and reputation if they ever try direct action or even combative tactics in the media. This happens a lot with elected representatives like AOC, etc..

- **(USA Exlusive) Asking Permission with Police Permits:** For any protest a police permit is mostly a meaningless piece of paper, they can be unilaterally revoked for any protest that does get them, and both permitted and unpermitted protests have all the same constitutional protections. The main reason IMO police departments push them so heavily is because they want people to get in the mindset of asking them for permission first

# The tactics are a sign of good organizing.

I personally have learned really like it when these tactics get used against orgs I am with.

Every campaign starts off not really challenging any power structures, in this stage these tactics are never going to be used against you because your action isn't even worthy of a response. If the system has the option of completely ignoring your action, it absolutely will.

Using these kinds of tactics against a campaign always costs the system something, whether that be time or organizational capacity. It wouldn't do that unless the campaign was actually working in causing pain to said power structures.

IMO its actually way more concerning to not get this pushback. Whats kinda funny is that the power structures have a much better understanding of threats to the status quo then we as organizers do. And when the system ignores you its good to take it's judgement seriously, as a real indication that your action is spinning its wheels and not getting anything done.

Its also extremely normal to find yourself in this situation, I would guess that roughly 90% of actions never get to the point of demanding a response from the powerful. If you find yourself in this situation its good to ignore questions about tone and messaging, and just try to focus on either escalating your current tactics, or trying new ones until you find something that works. Being in this phase of an action is very dangerous, in some ways it's designed to be psychologically comfortable and prevent you from trying anything else.

A good litmus test for a new action to ask yourself: "Could you imagine a staff member for <powerful person x> reaching out and telling us to tone it down?". Its helpful for trying to setting a good tone and also getting a level of escalation high enough to be actually impactful while still leaving room for more escalation down the road.

All that being said, once you get to this stage, (and taken some time to celebrate) you do need to actually deal with them

## Understanding and countering the tactics.

mostly boils down to three pieces of advice.

1. **Make sure your action has a concrete and actionable goal for your target to accomplish.**

In very general terms a good campaign by a small org targeting some actor should have action that they want their target to take.

- The action should be clear and well defined. (Less "Dear State Governor, please fix the healthcare system" and more "Dear State Governor, the legislature is passing a prescription drug pricing bill in 2 weeks, DO NOT VETO OR THREATEN TO VETO IT")

- The target should clearly be able to take the action. The classic "I cant do anything" maneuver can waste a ton of time and you can avoid it by spending some time up front clearly wording your request in such a way that it is obvious that they can fulfil it.

- Have the request be small enough the target could reasonably grant it, while also being substantial enough you would feel happy moving on to another campaign if it was granted. This is a tough line to tread, but its always possible to add more requests if your campaign is going well, and getting tangible political wins is important for building momentum, so going small at the beginning isn't a bad idea.

2. **Dont take advice from people who have a vested interest in seeing you fail.**

Good life advice generally, but especially true for political organizing. [Unlike lots of other areas in life political power, expecially political power between classes is a zero sum game (Rob Reich has a good lecture on this)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQS2ptfayVI).
In general this tells us that you dont loose much by ignoring all these offers, nothing really good can come from ignoring them, and 90% of the time the main goal of these is to get you to give up all the leverage for almost nothing in return. Sometimes these will come from affiliated NGO's or other political parties, but sometimes they are just hilariously craven attempts by the power structures to get you to give up.
There was one time when I got arrested (in a planned manner) and after releasing us on bail at 2:00 AM an random police officer casually and unprompted started talking about how he just loved the work we were doing, and how we could get so much more done if we just asked for police permits before all of our actions.

3. **Treat these offers like [draw offers in chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_by_agreement).**

I think it holds up a bit as an analogy because they aren't offering you everything, (otherwise they would have just conceded and completed the goal of your action. ) These offers tend to only be substantive if your campaign is going well, so I tend to say its always worthwhile to keep going. It can be a good idea depending on what your affinity group wants, if people are want a break or there is a new campaign that they are excited about, it can be worth it to take the small win and move on.

Taking these offers can be a great idea in the situation where you are an NVDA Affinity Group, partnering with a regular NGO, and your partner NGO likes the terms. This lets you get a substantial win, build good will with your partner org, and leave you as an org free of ongoing commitments, which means you can literally just move to the next campaign/collaboration next week without any loss of momentum.
