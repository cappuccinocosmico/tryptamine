I dont think so, but I think that in order to change political systems its essential to understand that at a fundamental level states are tools for manipulating, focusing and deploying violence and power. That comes in many forms, from invading other countries, deporting people to foreign concentration camps, or leaving people to freeze to death on the streets.



And even though most of us work at very high levels in politics, with potentially 7 layers of abstraction between us and the threat of police throwing people in jail. Understanding how those systems work is an essential part of figuring out effective ways of resisting. (This is even more important as state violence against 1st amendment speech ramps up)
