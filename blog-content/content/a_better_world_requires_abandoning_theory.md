# A Better World Requires Abandoning Theory

## Our words do have power

When I first started as an activist I belived the solution was a lack of awareness. When I first learned about the basics of climate change I was gripped with a desire to act and try and fix things.

So surely, if other people found out they would do the same thing...

Right...

After 3-4 years of failure, I moved on and so did the rest of the movement. We moved from community viewings of "An Inconvinent Truth" in search of other, hopefully more effective, methods of organizing a climate movement.

However, what if our words werent as powerless as we thought they were?

This revalation first came to me while I was reading this article specifically they argue that there is this extremely strong robust trend where people on the left tend to be much much less happy then people on the right.

Write more on the stats.

But regardless of how strong the underlying trends are I feel like every single activist knows these statistics are true deep down.

Out of all classes of people I know, the people who are the most depressed, and saddled with mental health diagnoses are activists. {Include personal annecdotes + examples.}

However what I think is that since accidentially we built our entire recruitment pipeline around trying to cause the greatest amount of depression, to everyone that is actually paying attention. And hope that a certain percentage of these people randonmly experience a high enough level of depression that it spurs them to action. (But also not so high it just saps all their motivation for change and leaves them in a state of despair)

However this presents a problem, (aside from the fact that activists may be paritally responsible for a generation of depression), but the structure of our onboarding pipeline means everyone who comes into the movement has such severe depression and anxiety about the future that they took active steps to allivate it by joining your particular group.

Activists have always suffered from a really bad attrition problem, the average activist only attends 1-2 protests arround for not a lot longer then 4-6 months across most spaces {citation},. Typically even in extremely high attrition fileds like teaching, almost everyone sticks it out for a year, and only 8% of them leave the field every year. I would guess activism has an attrition rate of 30-50%, {Citations from other people would be greatly appreciated.}
everyone who comes into a movement is

Another problem that a lot of these presentations is that integration with an activist movement involves you emotionally processing the outcomes of the climate work and getting in touch after 1 hour of processing time or less. This is even worse with social media where dealing with these apocolyptic emotions is harder since you have absolutely no support network.

## Goal based thinking leads to bad outcomes.

The most miserable people in any math/programming class are people that are focused on grades. And a big reason this exists is because you are thinking about the outcomes and not the actual process of doing the thing. And studies have shown that this leads to a

For activism this is kind of a similar pipeline, where most activists will focus exclusively on the outcomes, what is the coming climate apocalypse going to look like,

In this sense reading a lot about theory and unders

## Our Ideas Are Poisonus

## Understanding an extremely counterintuitive point.

Experience and understanding of a cause when first taking action, is reverse correlated to how long you stay. (All in all, the people who stick around in activist movements, are dispraprotinately likely to have started taking action when they knew almost nothing, or were very new to the movement.)

Why could this be the case, well I think there might be two reasons why this works

### Recontextualization

I feel that some experience doing activism colors the way you read and percieve theory. Your primary goal for engaging in this space is "How can I help with this particular problem" and thus all

### What Could I have done better?

But ultimately the responsibility for shaping a healthy culture falls on the organizers with the most experience. And this is something I have completely failed at. Mainly since my (and I think most activists) relationship with the work has never been healthy.

As long as I have been doing activism there has been this voice in the back of my head trying to get me to stop. It constantly says things like "Mathematics is the coolest thing ever, wouldn't it be great if you could do this all the time?", and "This work you are doing all the time is making you miserable, wouldn't it be great if you just let it all go and lived a happy life?"

I absolutely despise this voice, its so incredibly selfish. All it cares about is a certain arrangement of neurotransmitters in my brain, and its willing to sacrifice anything material to get it, even a chance at improving the happiness of future generations. And ever since it first showed up I wished for it to be silent, and I put a ton of work into strangling it.

When it would whisper these things to me, I would tell it it was delusional and sociopathic. How could it not have empathy for all the unborn children.

When it yelled these things at me, I would drown it out with news and thinkpieces about the coming climate apocalypse, and how unless people started caring, then nothing was going to get better.

And when it finally brought me to my knees and forced me to stop doing this work. I would make it suffer, surrounding myself with friends who were still doing stuff, and telling myself that such a self centered pathetic life wasnt worth living.

All of this worked extremely well, and is the main reason why I am still doing this after all this time.

But I don't think most people think of that little voice this way. Some might describe it as "your conscience", or "a small compass guiding you in the direction of happiness" - CGP Grey (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o). I for most people its the part of their brain that guides them towards having a happy and fulfilling life.

I always thought that other people who knew about the civilization al crises we face and didn't act was always some kind of issue on their part. Maybe they didn't know all the relevant theory, or had other life stuff going on that prevented them, or maybe they just didn't care.

I don't think that's true anymore, choosing the happiness and peace of a normal life over the dread and terror is the human brain acting normally. We assume as socialists that people are, at their core, fundamentally good and altruistic, then doesn't it make sense that 98% of people who hear our ideas disregard them in favor of listening to that voice?

We (the organizers) are the ones who are not normal.

I feel like this why so many of us with anxiety, depression, Autism, ADHD, OCD and other mental illnesses end up as organizers. Silencing that voice requires a certain self destructive tendency, and being able to have that already makes the process easier.

Its also why we cant go forward like this. Mass movements cant be powered by a small 0.1% cadre of people sacrificing their happiness to undemocratically change the system.

Its going to require everyone, even those who don't want to swallow the poison.

I previously thought I didn't have to change how I motivated myself, since if it was ruining anyones life, at least it was only mine. But its also probably hypocritical of me to say its necessary to completely uproot our entire methods of recruitment and retention and not at least try to change your own thought process to match.

Plus organizers are routinely given impossible tasks like "destroy capitalism" or "save the world". Compared to that finding enlightenment through non-toxic method of climate organizing seems downright easy :
