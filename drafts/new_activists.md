Commentor at 21:30 responding to stuff!

Hi, I'm glad you found my ramblings valuable! Although the more I think about it I think I completely agree with your critique about trying to prevent the "savior" narrative in newcomers. Its good for me to remember that in lots of spaces this attitude can be extremely damaging, from needlessly escalating with law enforcement and bringing it down into the communities they are trying to protect, to bringing a bunch of unprocessed racism/queerphobia into organizing circles. However in my background of climate organizing those problematic attitudes are less likely to cause conflict since most climate activists are financially well off white people.

I also feel that I was subconsciously trying to run interference for the horrific situation that activists encounter when getting started. People often fall into joining a traditional nonprofit, and get drafted into doing a bunch of organizational grunt work like fundraising or tabling. They also get frozen out of leadership since NGO's are often undemocratic and only consider feedback from full time paid staff. Decentralized resistance movements are better IMO, but they still don't have any great ways of training and on-boarding new recruits (a problem that is made much worse by the high turnover and temporary nature of these decentralized movements.) This leads to a collective amnesia effect where all the failures and expertise built in movements don't transfer over, and also prevents them from allying with other NGO's to provide pressure towards achieving a goal.

In retrospect it doesn't seem fair to ask new people to fix this system by going off and starting their own orgs, especially when doing so could rob them of friendships that tie them to the movement, as well as elders who could pass on their own knowledge. Fixing the on-boarding process so that new recruits can 

- Start doing high impact leadership work day 1 of joining an org.

- Have as many opportunities to learn and pick up new skills as possible. Even if they never apply those skills at that specific org.

- Be provided a good enough experience so that 80% of them don't leave in 6 months.

Implementing those fixes is going to be absolutely essential if we want these movements to have a remote chance at succeeding.

However, I do get that this isn't actionable advice for people in a YouTube comments section, so for those of you wanting more applicable advice, here you go:

1. FUCKING DO SOMETHING: Anything. It doesn't matter what. The important thing is to get in the habit of taking action based on your political beliefs. The best research on this (from books like "Making of a Pro Life Activist") is that caring about and believing in a cause in the abstract doesn't tend to lead anywhere. It suggests that the most dedicated activists were indifferent towards the cause in the beginning, but took action early and got caught in a beneficial cycle where their beliefs inspired them to take action, and said activism connected them with more reasons to care about the cause. Whatever you do, try to get this cycle started for yourself.
 
2. Have Fun: Treating activism as a hobby like a D&D game night or other social encounter has a ton of benefits. In the beginning it might not matter that your activism isn't fun, but this motivation/willpower waxes and wanes over time, so set yourself up for success by having other reasons for doing activism. Also your friends will provide peer pressure to keep doing it, and that's just a nice bonus :) If you aren't having fun in an organizing space, don't wait for the resentment and burnout to reach a peak, explore and try to find something fulfilling. 

If anyone is looking for specifics on how people with a STEM background can do activism, I might as well throw in a plug for my current project https://kessler.xyz , which aims to scrape a bunch of hard to access government data from Public Utility Commissions, City Councils and State Legislatures and make them easily accessible for activists. We are doing a lot of CS work to add relevant features for peeps, but I am also really curious about what people with more of a research background could do with this data.

Cheers!

And for those of you who





First, thats a totally valid thought to have and I'm sorry I dont have a great answer in general. I feel like its more of a common trend among impactful people in this space. As an example a friend with a Biochem PHD and a career in industry, was able to utilize a ton of that stem knowledge to get involved on the technical side of regulatory proceedings on air quality and the power grid. They eventually ended up leading a ton of citizen initiatives, and eventually got their city of 200,000 people off of the private power company, and into the hands of a publicly owned company that was going to build up to 3x the renewable energy of said power company.

However, she didn't magically just have the idea of starting her org, Clean Energy Action one day. It was the outgrowth of a ton of hard work, experimentation with different ways of doing organizing, and the development of new skills she learned along the way. So maybe the best thing to do would be to just try a bunch of different stuff, make connections and see what happens.

If you are curious about specific ways you might be able to help, I am totally down to chat. What skills were you talking about in particular?
