# Bleeding Out: How to do Mutual Aid Better

Activists on the left have a huge problem, namely dispite having poliicies that would unambiguously make the world better. We have been stuck in a cycle of organizing mass movements that are either to small or to short lived to bring about any lasting change.

How can we fix this?

A big contributor to this problem is a rate of burnout and churn among existing organizers, who tend to leave the movement after an average of 6 months. I think this is largely due to 2 problems.

- Emotional Grief and Anguish about the state of the world and how activism is currently set up to rub your face in your worst anxieties about the future. (Talked about here: <link>)

- Needing to cover basic living expenses like rent / food / utilities. Thus forcing said organizers to take on full time jobs and pour whatever extra time they have after other stuff into organizing.

This secondary point can lead to downward spirals. Both because doing activism part time while having a job often leads to you neglecting other activities important for recovering mental health. This might not traditionally lead to negative outcomes, but because activism is such a huge source of emotional distress trying to deal with that without extra emotional outlets can be really rough.

It seems like solving this problem could be really rough, but luckily we have a framework for dealing with these issues that anarchists already practice regularly.

## Mutual Aid: How it is done currently

- Increase the popularity of leftist economics by showing that it can provide regular resources for people.

## Mutual Aid: A New Framework for Supporting the Movement

If mutual aid really wants to contribute to the movement by:

- Enabling more people to organize full time

Then there are a couple of things that would need to change about how we currently do this:

1. Enabling Production Surpluses

Currently the methodology for a traditonal mutual aid group works like so:

- Use money gotten from a job (or donations) to directly purchase all commodities under capitalism. (99% of the time food)

- Spend most of the money and effort distributing said commodities to people in need. (I think the commonality of naming Mutual aid events "distros" is somewhat revealing here.)

However this runs into some problems, expecially since most radical socialists are poor, so trying to support an activist movement off the backs of this is unlikely to work out super well. There are a couple solutions:

- Radically decrease the cost of services provided by mutual aid

- Radically increase the productivity of said mutual aid services.

There is also another huge problem namely that in order to exist as a human under capitalism you need certain basic needs met, namely:

- Food/Water/Clothing

- Shelter

- Medical Care

- Transportation

- Emotional Connection and Community

However I feel like most mutual aid groups fall short in providing all but Food/Water. Which makes sense, in a country like the US where 1/3 of all food grown is wasted, and its possible to feed large numbers very cheaply with foods like beans and rice. However, the fact that it is so easy is explicitly why it isnt really that helpful. The average american spends 1.5 as much on transportation as on food, and around 2.5 times as much on housing compared to food.

Its also eminantly possible to budget and spend as little as 0-3$ a day on food. (While admittedly sacrificing both neutritional value, and time to actually cook the food. Going completely free with Dumpster Diving + Food Banks is always an option. ) However, for other aspects like housing, transportation or medical care there is always a floor (probably in the realm of 1.5-2x savings, but not the 10x savings you can get with food), you can only save so much on a rent bill now that even studio's or 1 bedroom apartments in cities are going for 1k a month. And other aspects like transportation and medical care get more expensive as you try to spend less.

## So how could we potentially solve this problem?

### Housing

At least for most activists out there the main reason land is expensive is because the land in cities is expensive.

## Retention and the Economic Problem

I wrote about retention in the last blog post,

## Shouldnt we have empathy for those less fortunate

- Arent there a ton of people suffering out there? Shouldnt mutual aid protect these people?

I think that this is a trap the left falls into a lot arround empathy.

Empathy is ultimately the reason we care enough to actually do stuff. And when actually trying to change the world feels impossible, its easy and understandable to fall back on trying to save a few people you know from the horrors of captialism and the rising tide of facism.

Whats unfortunate is that its never enough. Its hard to estimate how many people are regularly engaged in left political activism

\footnote{0.1% seems like a reasonable upper bound, considering that there might be 3,000 people in the denver metro area who are regularly engaged with this kind of organizing stuff.}

But regardless of the exact number there are always going to be more people who are brutalized by the criminal justice system, are homeless, or are queer and fleeing their community due to discrimination.
