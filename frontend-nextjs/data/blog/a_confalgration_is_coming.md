In the world of lefty post election takes, a consensus seems to be forming that the left is in such a defeated state that it might just be better to give up on organizing entirely.

> A: I don't think the left does shit. I'm sorry there's not a left in any capacity that matters for national organizing. There are individual local groups that can mean a lot for people in those areas. In terms of infrastructure of resistance, it's non-existent.
> None of it was ever built. The left was, you know, the Democratic Party is what we've been talking about this whole time. The left is split between some organizations like the PSL that are basically cults and influencers and their followers, which we to a degree fall into.
> There aren't parties or a real capacity for organizing a large revolutionary party or whateverâ€”that's a fantasy. It's not happening. It's also so factional and there's all this conflict; the left as a whole can't agree which genocides are real. They're not coming to save you from Trump. I think that you need to be thinking about talking to your community and your neighbors.

Both of these perspectives are somewhat understandable if you compare the externally visible states of organizing, mainly by looking at what organizations are preforming large actions, and do a comparision to the peak of organizing in 2020, things look absolutely fucked.

The period from 2016 to 2021 was a hotbed of organizing activity including huge actions arround:

- The Dakota Access Pipeline
- Line 3
- Extinction Rebellion
- All the Sunrise Movement Stuff
- March for Our Lives
- Fridays For Future
- The March for Science
-

However what I find most incredible about this surge in organizing energy, isnt the incredible surge, but how much it grew from its position pre-2016 to post-2016.

I feel like this is something most leftist analysis misses, because the movement grew so much after the bernie sanders 2016 primary we suffered a bit of collective ammnesia of the events prior to 2016.

# Leftist Organizing from 2001-2015 was not a fun time.

(You probably shouldn't trust my recollections about this too much since I am relying on memories from when I was 7-15. )

I remember this organizing in this time period felt like you were being gaslit constantly, when you tried to get any politician or anyone in power to do something an endless string of platitudes would come out of their mouth "we hear your concerns, but now is not the right time because of _blahblahblahblah_". There was a common consensus that the path to political victory lay in showing "An Inconvenient Truth"\footnote[1] to every person in the US. Major mass mobilization orgs like 350 or Al Gore's Climate Reality Project were (Note: Check to see how active greenpeace was in this time period and see if they were doing majorly escalating stuff during this time.)

This made criticising the current administration an absolute nightmare, both because you would get tons of pushback from obama worshipers, but also because playing nice and currying favor with the current administration was the only way to get them to take your concerns seriously and listen to you. Every other form of activism was dismissed as "unserious".

This even effected largely technocratic projects. In the first year of the Juliana vs US lawsuit, the vast majority of our interviews always included a question asking why we were suing the poor Obama administration with all of its super ambitious climate goals, with us (a bunch of literal children) needing to explain that all of their measures didn't actually impose limits on industry that they weren't already obeying for economic reasons, and was also placing the us on a 4-5 degree warming path instead of a 2 degree one. When Trump got elected I remember recieving legal advice saying "This election really helps your case, since it really highlights your main argument that the executive and legislative branches are incapable of addressing climate change."

However, no movement was damaged by this sentiment as much as Occupy Wall Street, it was mercilessly mocked by everyone, mainstream media, progressive media, comedy shows, and even other activists circles. The popular sentiment was captured very well by a bit john oliver did for the daily show at the time:

> Oliver uses the "people's mic" to tell the crowd, "The human microphone... while well-intentioned... is incredibly annoying... and embodies everything... people find frustrating... about movements like this!" He later repairs to a local bar where he shares a beer with "normal people" (i.e. olds) who also object to the inequities in the economic system but agree the Occupy Wall Street movement needs normal folk. "You know what my favorite part of your point is?" Oliver asks one of them. "You don't have crazy tattoos all over your face."

Afterwards occupy is largely viewed as a total failure, a "blip", and a movement that was more engaged in performative outrage and wasn't able to accomplish any of its actual goals.

I think its better to think of it as a spark from which the rest of the protest movement grew.

# 2016

The 2 main important events that happened in 2016 to help catalyze this movement were.

1. The extremely popular campaign of Bernie Sanders, and the rallying of all the DNC figureheads and obama behind hillary Clinton's primary. Making it crystal clear to lots of progressives that the democratic leadership are categorically opposed to almost all of the positive improvements we were wanting to make. And blaming the republicans or their own incompetence was just an excuse to hide the fact that they didnt actually want to do any of it. (In addition to being the political awakening for a lot of young people.)

2. Clinton loosing to Trump, cutting off the ability of liberals to lobby the presidency to achieve their goals, and also striking a huge blow to their faith that "the system has it all figured out".

# The people who were in occupy eventually lead other movements

On the bright side, taking such a shallow view is a really bad way of judging the health of a movement and in particular the ability of said movement to grow.

# Movement health has more to do with how motivated people are to take action and the Collective Experience of the Organizers, then anything that is being organized at the current moment.

I think both of these perspectives illustrate huge failures

# The State of Organizing Has Been much weaker then before.
