In the world of lefty post election takes, a consensus seems to be forming that the left is in such a defeated state that it might just be better to give up on organizing entirely.

> None of it was ever built. The left was, you know, the Democratic Party is what we've been talking about this whole time. The left is split between some organizations like the PSL that are basically cults and influencers and their followers, which we to a degree fall into.
> There aren't parties or a real capacity for organizing a large revolutionary party or whateverâ€”that's a fantasy. It's not happening. It's also so factional and there's all this conflict; the left as a whole can't agree which genocides are real. They're not coming to save you from Trump. I think that you need to be thinking about talking to your community and your neighbors.

Both of these perspectives are somewhat understandable if you compare the externally visible states of organizing, mainly by looking at what organizations are preforming large actions, and do a comparision to the peak of organizing in 2020, things look absolutely fucked.

The period from 2016 to 2021 was a hotbed of organizing activity including huge actions arround:

- The Dakota Access Pipeline
- Line 3
- Extinction Rebellion
- All the Sunrise Movement Stuff
- March for Our Lives
- Fridays For Future
- The March for Science
-

However what I find most incredible about this surge in organizing energy, isnt the incredible surge, but how much it grew from its position pre-2016 to post-2016.

I feel like this is something most leftist analysis misses, because the movement grew so much after the bernie sanders 2016 primary we suffered a bit of collective ammnesia of the events prior to 2016.

# Leftist Organizing from 2001-2015 was not a fun time.

(You probably shouldn't trust my recollections about this too much since I am relying on memories from when I was 7-15. )

I remember this organizing in this time period felt like you were being gaslit constantly, when you tried to get any politician or anyone in power to do something an endless string of platitudes would come out of their mouth "we hear your concerns, but now is not the right time becasue of _blahblahblahblah_". With a common concensus emerging

On the bright side, taking such a shallow view is a really bad way of judging the health of a movement and in particular the ability of said movement to grow.

# Movement health has more to do with how motivated people are to take action and the Collective Experience of the Organizers, then anything that is being organized at the current moment.

I think both of these perspectives illustrate huge failures

# The State of Organizing Has Been much weaker then before.
