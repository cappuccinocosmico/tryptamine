# A Better World Requires Abandoning Theory

## Our words do have power

When I first started as an activist I belived the solution was a lack of awareness. When I first learned about the basics of climate change I was gripped with a desire to act and try and fix things.

So surely, if other people found out they would do the same thing...

Right...

After 3-4 years of failure, I moved on and so did the rest of the movement. We moved from community viewings of "An Inconvinent Truth" in search of other, hopefully more effective, methods of organizing a climate movement.

However, what if our words werent as powerless as we thought they were?

This revalation first came to me while I was reading this article specifically they argue that there is this extremely strong robust trend where people on the left tend to be much much less happy then people on the right.

Write more on the stats.

But regardless of how strong the underlying trends are I feel like every single activist knows these statistics are true deep down.

Out of all classes of people I know, the people who are the most depressed, and saddled with mental health diagnoses are activists. {Include personal annecdotes + examples.}

However what I think is that since accidentially we built our entire recruitment pipeline around trying to cause the greatest amount of depression, to everyone that is actually paying attention. And hope that a certain percentage of these people randonmly experience a high enough level of depression that it spurs them to action. (But also not so high it just saps all their motivation for change and leaves them in a state of despair)

However this presents a problem, (aside from the fact that activists may be paritally responsible for a generation of depression), but the structure of our onboarding pipeline means everyone who comes into the movement has such severe depression and anxiety about the future that they took active steps to allivate it by joining your particular group.

Activists have always suffered from a really bad attrition problem, the average activist only attends 1-2 protests arround for not a lot longer then 4-6 months across most spaces {citation},. Typically even in extremely high attrition fileds like teaching, almost everyone sticks it out for a year, and only 8% of them leave the field every year. I would guess activism has an attrition rate of 30-50%, {Citations from other people would be greatly appreciated.}
everyone who comes into a movement is

Another problem that a lot of these presentations is that integration with an activist movement involves you emotionally processing the outcomes of the climate work and getting in touch after 1 hour of processing time or less. This is even worse with social media where dealing with these apocolyptic emotions is harder since you have absolutely no support network.

## Understanding an extremely counterintuitive point.

Experience and understanding of a cause when first taking action, is reverse correlated to how long you stay. (All in all, the people who stick around in activist movements, are dispraprotinately likely to have started taking action when they knew almost nothing, or were very new to the movement.)

Why could this be the case, well I think it makes sense in terms
