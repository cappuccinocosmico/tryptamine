So When I first saw this video by Neptunium, (And later a 3b1b video) I was curious if using only the measurement technhiques that existed back then, with the benefit of hindsight, is there another experiment one could devise to measure the distance to the sun?

Using the math of lunar eclipses, the ancient greeks were able to figure out the following units with pretty high accuracy using the radius of the earth as a measuring stick.

Given that $R_E$ is the radius of the earth

they calculated the distance to the moon by observing that a lunar eclipse takes 3.5 hours, to traverse the shadow of the earth during an eclipse. Given that a lunar month is 28 days,

$$\frac{D_M}{R_E} \approx \frac{28 \text{days}}{3.5 \text{hours}}$$

Giving you

$$D_M \approx 61 \cdot R_E$$

And you can use the fact that moonrises and moonsets take 2 minutes to know that

$$\frac{2*R_M}{2*\pi*D_M} =  \frac{2 \text{minutes}}{24 \text{hours}}$$

$$R_M \approx 0.26 *R_E $$

From here measuring the distance to the sun is much harder considering that the distance is so large:
$$D_S =23241 $$

I thought I would start off with newton's law of gravitation
