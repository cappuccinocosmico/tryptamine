Hey, this video, and the series as a whole, has been absolutely incredible so far.

I just wanted to bring up this minor nitpick namely that IMO actual organizers developing power maps often seems more effective in theory than in practice.

Mainly because power maps can oversimplify the complexities of a political campaign by condensing them into a single graph. And tend to only be as useful as the information you put into them, which tends to mean they suffer from 2 common failures.

1. Best Case: An affinity group (AG) will be newbies in a specific campaign, and just decide to go ahead and make a power map. Said power map will end up being totally wrong about the political situation, and it wont end up being that useful for planning any direct action.

2. Worst Case: An AG will be moderately knowledgeable in a campaign, and will try to compensate for inaccuracies by spending 2-4 weeks doing research on a power map. At the end the map will still have a bunch of inaccuracies, but more importantly, the group just spent a couple weeks trying to answer the problem "Who could we target?", and haven't made any progress on other components of doing a direct action such as:
   a. Which of these targets are actually feasible for us to target?
   b. What exact direct action tactics are you using in your action?
   c. How does this action fit in as an escalation in a longer campaign, and what could be the next step in escalation after this action?
   d. How are you going to control the narrative around your direct action?
   e. What people are going to take important roles in your action?
   f. How are you keeping everyone safe with good operational security?

There are absolutely activists who have spent 5-15 years working on a single issue that I would totally trust to bang out an accurate power map in a couple hours. And if you have someone like that in your affinity group, disregard all my above complaints, but assuming you dont here is what I would recommend instead.

# A better path

On almost every single fight, there is going to be some veteran community organizer who has been working on this campaign since forever. The first thing your group should do is reach out to one of these people and ask them:

- What is the general landscape of this campaign, what are the main powers at play?
- Is there any particular weak point where a bunch of outside pressure could be helpful?
- Is this a situation where nonviolent direct action could backfire?
  And use those answers to formulate a plan for a direct action

SIDE NOTE: These people are always incredibly easy to get in contact with and respond very well to cold emails. They have to spend a ton of time trying to get people to care about these issues, and will be more then happy to spend 30 minutes talking to you about ways to plug in.

This can be really helpful for these veteran organizers, even if they already know how to plan direct actions. Largely because they have spent 5-15 years cultivating "respectability" and connections in the local community, and don't want to loose them by planning a divisive direct action. But if they just consult with an affinity group, they can bring the force of a well designed direct action on a problem while still maintaining the reputation required to work within the system.

The last few affinity groups I have worked with all used this system and its worked incredibly well, delivering actual political wins with surprising consistently.

Anyway, I hope you keep up the great work and hope to see where the series goes from here. If you are looking for some more resources I would highly highly recommend the "Earth First Direct Action Manual" (just google it to get a pdf). Its a super comprehensive reference on everything you would ever need to know about planning direct actions, and reading it was the main thing that got me into planning actions in the first place.

PS: I do think they have a lot of potential as aids for education and training. Specifically because they can convey a lot of information about a political situation very quickly and you don't have the same worries about bad information compared to planning an action with an AG.
