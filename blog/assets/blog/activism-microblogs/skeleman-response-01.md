Yeah I will see if I can find some time to do that. I have been trying to force myself to write down my thoughts on organizing for a while, and having an actual structure to write could be nice.

Pages you sent were interesting, here's a couple thoughts so far:

## Needlessly Pendantic Critique: I dont know if "radicals, idealists, and realists" are more "modes of problem solving" than "types of activists"

The main differences in ideology is that they can unlock different methods of solving problems. Anarchists frequently lobby regulatory agencies or canvas for political candidates. But it isn't common to find socially progressive liberals trying to shut down construction of an oil pipeline.

I think its probably better to describe them as "modes of operation" for individual activists, and the broader organizations that they interact with. (Although describing them as types of Organizations/Affinity Groups is still pretty accurate.)
