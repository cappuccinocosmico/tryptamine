## Pendantic Critique: I think "radicals, idealists, and realists" are more "modes of problem solving" than "types of activists"

There absolutely are organizations and activists that really only focus on one type. Lots of orgs do more then one type, and activists often switch what kind of tactics they bring to bear on an issue depending on what they think is most effective.

This isnt to say ideology is unimportant, but it has more to do with unlocking different methods of solving problems. Anarchists frequently lobby regulatory agencies or canvas for political candidates. But it isn't common to find socially progressive liberals trying to shut down construction of an oil pipeline.

All the political analysis about the types is totally accurate though. The power structures try to make doing radical activism miserable and try to paint idealistic and realistic methods as easier and more effective. Likewise, always try to push the people doing idealistic activism into realistic activism using all the tricks talked about in the book.

## A couple more tricks

- **(USA Exclusive) Play around with 501c3 non profit status.** Â This is given to nonprofits at the IRS's discretion and can be revoked at any time, which can completely shut off an organizations ability to accept donations. This typically means that certified nonprofits never touch or work with orgs who do NVDA, just because planning or associating with them can potentially cause problems for the org's certification.

- **Power needs connections.** An org/activist can totally tank their credibility and reputation if they ever try direct action or even combative tactics in the media. This happens a lot with elected representatives like AOC, etc..

- **(USA Exlusive) Asking Permission with Police Permits:** For any protest a police permit is mostly a meaningless peice of paper, they can be unilaterally revoked for any protest that does get them, and both permitted and unprermiited protests have all the same constitutional protections. The main reason IMO police departments push them so heavily is because they want people to get in the mindset of asking them for permission first

# The tactics are a sign of good organizing.

I personally have learned really like it when these tactics get used against orgs I am with.

Every campaign starts off not really challanging any power structures, in this stage these tactics are never going to be used against you because your action isnt even worthy of a response. If the system has the option of completely ignoring your action, it absolutely will.

Using these kinds of tactics against a campaign always costs the system something, whether that be time or organizational capacity. It wouldn't do that unless the campaign was actually working in causing pain to said power structures.

IMO its actually way more concerning to not get this pushback. Whats kinda funny is that the power structures have a much better understanding of threats to the status quo then we as organizers do. And when the system ignores you its good to take it's judgement seriously as a real indication that your action is spinning its wheels and not getting anything done.
(Its also a good litmus test for a new action, to ask yourself "could you imagine a staff member for <powerful person x> telling us to tone it down". can be helpful for trying to set a good tone and level of escalation)

Often these requests can come from weird locations, like members of other NGO's and community orgs. There was one time when I got arrested (in a planned manner) and after releasing us at 2:00 AM an off duty officer casually and unprompted started talking about how he loved the work we were doing, and how we could get so much more done if we started asking for police permits.

Using these tactics always costs the power structures something in time and organizational capacity.
