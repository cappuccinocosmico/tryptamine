Just browsing through this now, I completly agree with what everyone else has said.

Moreover I dont really know what the purpose of those large jail support orgs, they only really seem to be useful to me if:

1. You are going to a protest with no jail support, and dont have a friend you can call.
2. You need to rope in more legal resources on an already established case.

If you do get arrested you are most of the time you are predominantly worried about 

1. Notifying friends/family/loved ones that you have gotten arrested.
2. Taking care of logistical stuff like:
 - Letting your boss know you probably aren't coming into work tomorrow.
 - Moving your car out of 2 hour parking.
 - Getting someone to feed your pets.
3. Getting your bail paid as soon as possible to get you out as soon as possible.

All of these are things that an existing bail support numbers are not going to be able to help with. Expecially since most of the time you get arrested you arent going to be able to call anyone of 2-3 hours. Most of those logistical things need to be taken of really quickly. And the only way to deal with them immediately is to let someone trusted know the info ahead of time.
