Notes for improvement
- More time is a good idea, I pulled it out at 22ish hours out of an abundance of caution. I feel like going up to 155 is a good move, plus actually going for the 36 hours is probably not a bad idea.
- Good idea to absolutely remove all liquid from bag prior to sous vide. Save liquid for other stuff.
- Adding another 5-10 grams of regular salt is probably a good idea.
- More sugar is also pretty safe.
- Grated onion not an important edition.
- Extra Stuff like mustard or other spices are a good idea.
