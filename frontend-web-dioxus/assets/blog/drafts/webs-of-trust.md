# What is a Movement Specific Risk?


1. Its really hard to model threats that a specific individual or organisation might face from an oppressive state power.

2. Since its such a hard problem, most of the research has gone into solving the problem for organisation types that are rather simple. For example:

- What can you as an individual to free yourself from government survalience?

- How can whistleblowers lead information to anonomously to journalists, and how can said journalists prevent themselves from getting pwned by governments.

- How can crews of hackers successfully hack governments without being detected.

However, all of these use cases have fairly simple social structures, 

- individauls dont have any social structure to worry about 
- journalists and whistleblowers only need to solve the problem of how to communicate with each other anonomously. 
- Crews of hackers can have a closed group of people who are completely trusted, and only need to worry about how to prevent any accidents from group members, these orgs are not designed to survive law enforcement infiltration among the core group.

Mass movements (including unions, protests, and NVDA groups) inherit almost all of the risks from all of the individual use cases, but have a whole new class of vunrabilities to worry about,

- An **Inherited Risk** is a risk that movements have in common with these simpler problem sets. 

- A **Movement Specific Risk** is a risk that is unique to a movements that these simpler orgs dont have to worry about.

The main difference between these simpler orgs and movements, is that because movements need to interact with the broader community and grow. As such they need to have an open structure to incorperate these new members into the group, and closing up the group to make it less open is always going to make the movement less effective.


There are lots of kinds of movement specific risk, but a few common types are:


1. **Infiltration Risk**: Standard law enforcement officers pretend to be activists to get inside the movement.

2. **Messaging Risk**: Since movements need to communicate with the outside world.
